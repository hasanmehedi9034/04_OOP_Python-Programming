"""
Above This code we have two function first one is dp second one is  p. P have  two  index from lists. soo for example we can see p is  ( [1 , 2 , 3] , [4 , 5 , 6 ] , 1 )  return value   from  the two lists, which is 2 * 5. On the other hand dp uses p to multiply all  elements from  two lists in the arguments So, for the two lists in the function call, we get ( 1 * 4 ) + ( 2 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 6 ) which is 4 + 10 + 18= 32.
So we get 32 is the result of above this  code.
