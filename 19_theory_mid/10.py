In this present   days computer systems is very popular for store data,modern computer system  files always have names. File is  located in directories.  file name within a directory must be unique. In other words,  two files in a directory may have the same name.file's name and the path to the file's directory uniquely identifies other files in the computer system no two files can have the same name and path. The appearance of the name depends on the type of computer system . Early computers permitted only a few letters or digits in the name of a file, but modern computers allow long names containing almost any combination of unicode letters or unicode digits, making it easier to understand the purpose of a filecomputer systems use extensions in file names to help identify.
 
On the other hand when a file or folder has been saved, it will have a specific address on the computer, just as you have one for your home.  This "address," or where a file lives, is called a path.  For example  example(Win):  C:\Windows\\bin\wet.dllThis path says the following This file is stored on the "C" drive (c:\), file is named "redme.txt" and it is an text docume because it has a .txt extension on it.  Notice that each level of this separated by a backslash "\".  The highest level is the drive; the lowest level is the file name. 

The operating system can maintain separate files of the same name by following ways which are givenbelow:
 File size:- Two files  extension and name can be the same but their file size can be different.
Path:- Two files path can different from one another
Time:- Creating two files time and date can be different from one another.
Contents:- Two files content can also be different from one another.
